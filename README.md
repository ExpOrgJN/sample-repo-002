# sample-repo-002
This is sample repository getting created from command line but interactively

GITHUB_TOKEN permissions
By default, looks like for me the GITHUB_TOKEN have only read permission.
I tried to change these through settings. But it remains greyed out for me.
I tried to provide write permissions in the yaml file. It works.
